In order to run, navigate to the correct directory. Use the command "make" to compile,
then use ./run < (name of text input file in directory)

I've included a sample input file (input.txt), so to run using redirection from said file
use the command ./run < input.txt.

To manually input, simply use ./run, and use ctrl + c when you have finished to exit.
